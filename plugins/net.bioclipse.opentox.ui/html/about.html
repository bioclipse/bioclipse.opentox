<h1>About OpenTox</h1>
OpenTox is a web framework that supports the building of toxicology models, validation and open data exchange. Read more about the OpenTox project on their <a href="http://www.opentox.org/">website</a>. Bioclipse uses the OpenTox web-service to evaluate the toxicity properties in various molecules, for example in the decision support feature.<br/><br/>
To use all funktions in the OpenTox feature you need to register an account on OpenToxs website, but several functions will work any way. Also worth to mention is that some of the models in the decision suport feature needs an Opentox account. If you want to create an account for OpenTox, click <a href="http://www.opentox.org/join_form">here</a> to get to the OpenTox registration form. Then you need to provide Bioclipse with the login information, see <a href="./install.html">Install OpenTox in Bioclipse</a>
